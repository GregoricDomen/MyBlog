Sadly i haven't been yet in Asia. Probably now that i will finish my univerity,before i get a job i will definetly go to Asia. On my wish list the is definetly Thailand and Japan. Thailand because  of the beautiful beaches and the local street food and Japan because of the big cities like Tokio or Osaka and because of their food (Sushi &#x1F60D;)
