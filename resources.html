<h3>
How do i pick my destinations
</h3>
<p>
Mostly i picked my destinations randomly, or was the price of the flight low or the city was cheap. Only for the destinations i planned. For Portugal where i went to visit a friend of mine and Berlin, to watch Slovenia volleyball national team.
</p>

<h3>
Where to find informations about cities that you are visiting
</h3>

<p>
Because i'm not much of a planner, i never pick the destinations because of the landmarks, but when i pick a destination, then i check what is there too see. 
<br><br>
<li><a>Internet</a></li>
<p> 
You check for website about cities, about what to see, prices, where to stay ( my favourite option the book a night is <a href="https://www.booking.com">Booking.com</a> )
<br><br>
Almost every city have their on website, so tourist can check what to see, where to stay and even where to eat. Here is an example of my city where their webpage is giving you information about local destinations and their company. This site here is for <a href="https://turizem-novagorica-vipavskadolina.si">Nova Gorica</a>.
</p>
<li>Books and tour guides</li>

<p>
If you ever come to Nova Gorica, we have a great library (<a href="https://www.gkfb.si/">Bevkova knji≈ænica</a>) to get books about our city or even some tour guides for bigger citis like Barcellona, London, Prague, etc.
