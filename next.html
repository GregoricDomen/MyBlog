This trip i booked with my friends in the end of April, Amsterdam have been a lot of time in my wish list and i can't wait to see this wonderful city with all the architecture, tulipan fields and many interesting museums.
<br><br>
<li>Ireland</li>
Next destination will probabily be Ireland. I friend of mine whom i visited in Portugal will be moving to Dublin. And one thing i'm most excited for is that this will be probaly my first trip alone, so i just can't wait.

<h3>My dream destinations</h3>

<li>New Zeland</li>
<p>
I always dreamt of New Zeland because of the nature and the culture that is there, another thing i want to do in New Zeland is surfing. I already sirfed a few times and i read that there are the most amazeing waves.
<br><br>
<li>Japan</li>
Sushi, ramen, tempura. I love this food and i can't wait to try what is the original taste of this food in Japan. I hope i can travel there in spring to see all stuning views where all the trees blossom and i can chill in the first sun of the world.
