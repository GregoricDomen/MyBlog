<h3>Two destinations of Spain</h3>

	<h2>
		Sevilla
	</h2>
	<p>
In 2018, I had the pleasure of visiting Seville, a city in southern Spain, for a five-day vacation. Seville is a beautiful city, full of history and culture, and it was an incredible experience to explore its charming streets, sample its delicious food, and immerse myself in its rich heritage.
<br><br>
On the first day, I explored the city's famous landmarks, including the Seville Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Its impressive architecture and intricate details left me in awe. I also visited the Giralda tower, which stands adjacent to the cathedral, and offers a breathtaking view of the city from the top.
<br><br>
The next day, I took a stroll through the picturesque neighborhood of Santa Cruz, the old Jewish quarter, with narrow streets, white-washed houses, and charming courtyards filled with colorful flowers. I visited the Alcazar, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is a stunning palace and garden complex with a mix of architectural styles, including Gothic, Mudejar, and Renaissance.
<br><br>
On the third day, I explored the Triana neighborhood, located across the Guadalquivir River. I enjoyed visiting the Triana Market, where I tasted delicious local specialties, such as Iberian ham, olives, and cheese. I also visited the Ceramics Museum, which showcases the traditional art of ceramics and pottery in Seville.
<br><br>
On the fourth day, I visited the Plaza de Espana, a magnificent square with a unique architectural style that combines Renaissance and Moorish influences. The square was built for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition and features tiled alcoves representing each province of Spain. I also walked along the beautiful Maria Luisa Park, which is full of fountains, ponds, and monuments.
<br><br>
On the final day of my trip, I visited the Metropol Parasol, an impressive modern structure that offers panoramic views of the city. I also visited the Museum of Fine Arts, which has an extensive collection of Spanish art, including works by Murillo, Velázquez, and Zurbarán.
<br><br>
Overall, my five-day vacation in Seville was an unforgettable experience. The city's vibrant culture, rich history, and delicious cuisine left me with memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. I highly recommend Seville as a destination for anyone who wants to explore the beauty of southern Spain.

	<h2>
		Tenerife
	</h2>
	<p>
Tenerife is one of the most beautiful islands in the Canary Islands archipelago, located off the coast of Africa. In 2019, I had the pleasure of visiting Tenerife for 11 days and it was one of the most amazing trips of my life. During my stay, I enjoyed three days of surf lessons, a hike on Teide, and rented a car to explore the island.
<br><br>
I started my trip with three days of surf lessons in a small town called El Medano. The town is located on the south coast of Tenerife and is known for its long sandy beach and windy conditions, making it the perfect spot for surfing. I had never surfed before, but with the help of a professional instructor, I learned how to catch waves and ride them. It was a great experience that allowed me to enjoy the ocean in a new and exciting way.
<br><br>
The next day, I went on a hike on Teide, which is the highest mountain in Spain, and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The hike was challenging, but the stunning views of the surrounding landscape made it worthwhile. However, the weather conditions were windy and made the hike more challenging. Despite the wind, the view from the top was breathtaking, and it was a great feeling to have reached the summit.
<br><br>
After the hike, I rented a car to explore the island. I visited many places, including the picturesque town of Garachico, with its charming colonial architecture and volcanic beaches. I also drove to the Anaga Rural Park, which is a beautiful nature reserve that offers a stunning view of the Atlantic Ocean.
<br><br>
I also visited the town of La Orotava, with its beautiful gardens and historic houses. It was interesting to learn about the town's history and culture, and I enjoyed walking through its cobblestone streets and admiring the colorful architecture.
<br><br>
In conclusion, my 11-day trip to Tenerife was an incredible experience. Surfing in El Medano, hiking on Teide, and exploring the island in a rental car were just a few of the highlights of my trip. The island has so much to offer, from its beautiful beaches and scenic hiking trails to its charming towns and rich culture. I highly recommend Tenerife as a destination for anyone who loves adventure, nature, and culture.
