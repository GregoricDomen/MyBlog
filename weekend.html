		In this section a had only one weekend getaway and it was to Edinbrough that i described in my section <a href="Europe.html">Europe</a>. So if you would like to know more,check it there. Probably in the future i will have more weekend getaways, because it's just a few day and you don't even have to take some extra days off at work.
