<h3>
Munchen
</h3>
	<p>
 Traveling to new places is always an exciting experience, and my 5-day trip to Munich with my school at the age of 18 was no exception. Munich, the capital city of Bavaria in Germany, is known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture.
<br><br>
During our trip, we visited several iconic attractions in Munich, such as the Neuschwanstein Castle, which is a fairytale castle built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. We also visited the Marienplatz, the central square of Munich, which is known for its beautiful architecture, including the famous Glockenspiel clock tower.
<br><br>
We also took a tour of the BMW Museum and Factory, where we learned about the history of the famous car manufacturer and witnessed the manufacturing process of the vehicles. We even got a chance to test drive some of the latest models, which was a thrilling experience.
<br><br>
One of the most memorable experiences of our trip was visiting the Hofbr√§uhaus, a traditional beer hall in Munich, where we tasted some of the best Bavarian beers and enjoyed the lively atmosphere. We also visited several local markets and tried the delicious traditional German cuisine, such as sausages, pretzels, and schnitzels.
<br><br>
In addition to the city's attractions, we also got to experience the local culture and interact with the friendly locals. We learned some basic German phrases and tried to communicate with the locals in their language, which made our experience even more enjoyable.
<br><br>
Overall, my trip to Munich with my school was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget. The stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant culture of Munich left a lasting impression on me, and I would love to visit the city again someday. This trip not only allowed me to explore a new place, but also helped me learn about different cultures and broaden my perspective.
